Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

Instructions
Design the following database schema containing three tables:

Database Schema

department:

id - INT PRIMARY KEY
name - VARCHAR(30) to hold department name
role:

id - INT PRIMARY KEY
title - VARCHAR(30) to hold role title
salary - DECIMAL to hold role salary
department_id - INT to hold reference to department role belongs to
employee:

id - INT PRIMARY KEY
first_name - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name
last_name - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name
role_id - INT to hold reference to role employee has
manager_id - INT to hold reference to another employee that manager of the current employee. This field may be null if the employee has no manager
Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

Add departments, roles, employees

View departments, roles, employees


We can frame this challenge as follows:

As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

Use the MySQL NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

Use InquirerJs NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

Use console.table to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of console.table, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.
